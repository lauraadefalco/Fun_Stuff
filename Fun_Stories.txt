This is a collection of hilarious stories.

1. My high school had many sets of stairs, some of which were uncovered. 
One day, I was walking down one of these uncovered staircases. But this 
day, it had just rained, so the paint on the stairs was wet and slippery. 
As I walked down the stairs, my feet fully slipped out from underneath me. I 
had also made the bad decision of not holding the railing. So, I fell 
directly onto my back. However, my backpack was so thick (because of all 
of the textbooks I had to have for school) that it broke my fall, and my 
head did not touch the ground. Thanks to all of the textbooks (which I 
resented at the time because they were heavy), I evaded a concussion. I 
got up as quickly as possible, tried to pretend that it didn't happen, and 
continued with my day.
